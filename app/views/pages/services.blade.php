		<p class="section-title">Stewardship Coaching</p>
		<p class="text">Many families and business owners are experienced

			Financial wealth, planning and confidence can make it

		<p class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
		<p class="text">
			<span class="bold">What types of clients do you work with?</span><br>
			Our clients have many different backgrounds but there 
			are a number of common traits among them. They 
			have the ability to become or already are financially 
			independent. They prefer to free up their time and use 
			our experience, expertise and tools to delegate some 
			of the responsibility of managing their wealth. Though 
			we do not follow strict guidelines for client 
			qualification, those who receive the most value 
			typically meet some or all of the following:
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="text">
			Income in excess of $150,000/year
			Investable assets of $350,000 or greater
			A net worth of $1M or greater
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="text">
			<span class="bold">Who is Securities America, Inc.?</span><br>
			Securities America is our broker/dealer. Think of them 
			as behind-the-scenes support to us. They provide 
			technology, compliance and operational services to 
			help us provide comprehensive and professional 
			services. They were established in 1984, are 
			headquartered in Omaha, NE, and serve over 1,700 
			financial advisors across the United States.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="text">

			<span class="bold">What is a Certified Financial Planner?</span><br>
			Most people think that all financial planners are 
			"certified," but this isn’t true. Only those who have 
			fulfilled the certification and renewal requirements of 
			the CFP Board can display the CFP® certification 
			marks. When selecting a financial planner, you need 
			to feel confident that the person you choose to help 
			you plan for your future is competent and ethical. The 
			CFP® certification provides that sense of security by 
			allowing only those who meet strict education, 
			examination, experience and ethics requirements the 
			right to use the CFP® certification marks.

		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="text">

			<span class="bold">How are you paid? </span><br>
			We are fee-based, meaning most of our revenue 
			comes from the fees paid for either financial planning 
			and/or investment management services. Some fees 
			are paid directly while others are paid from your 
			investment accounts. On occasion, we may use a 
			commissionable product if we feel it is in the best 
			interest of the client. All fees are clearly disclosed. For 
			more information or to request a fee schedule, please 
			contact our office.
